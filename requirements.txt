# requirements.txt (for FastAPI backend - Local Development)

# Core FastAPI framework
fastapi

# ASGI server needed to run FastAPI (includes standard dependencies like websockets)
uvicorn[standard]

# For making HTTP requests (to call Gemini API)
requests

# For loading environment variables (like API keys) from a .env file
python-dotenv

# Vector database for storing and searching embeddings
chromadb

# For generating text embeddings
sentence-transformers

# ----- Optional, but recommended by ChromaDB -----
# For faster JSON parsing (ChromaDB dependency)
# orjson # Uncomment if needed, pip might install it as a chromadb dependency anyway

# For server performance monitoring (ChromaDB dependency)
# psutil # Uncomment if needed

# ----- Notes -----
# sentence-transformers will pull in larger libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
# FastAPI has built-in CORS middleware support (configured in your main.py),
# so Flask-Cors is not needed here.
# Gunicorn is NOT included as it's primarily for production deployment.
# Uvicorn (uvicorn main:app --reload) is used to run FastAPI locally.
