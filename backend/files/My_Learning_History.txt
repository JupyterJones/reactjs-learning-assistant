Question: I am using python as my backend.
Answer: In a ReactJS application using Python as a backend, React handles the front-end (user interface) while Python powers the back-end (data processing, logic, database interaction).  React makes API calls (typically using `fetch` or `axios`) to your Python backend (e.g., a Flask or Django application running on a server) to retrieve and send data.  The Python backend processes requests, interacts with databases if necessary, and sends responses back to the React front-end for display.  Essentially, they're two separate parts of a complete web application working together.
